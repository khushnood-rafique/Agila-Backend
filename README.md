AgilA is a tool that permits consistency checking in the whole product life cycle, from very left (requirements elicitation) to right (operation). AgilA consists of frontends and a backend. The backend consists of a database with a constraint net that checks consisteny of design properties. The backend offers microservices via a REST API.

## Note:
Due to copyright restrictions, I am unable to upload the entire project to a public repository. Instead, Iâ€™ve shared a representative portion of the code. The functionality remains intact, and the key entities used in the final project are included.
